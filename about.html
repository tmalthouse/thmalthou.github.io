            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I am a senior physics major at Reed College, in Portland, OR. My interests include quantum computing, solid-state theory, and field theory. I’m currently writing a thesis on the simulation of open quantum systems, advised by <a href="https://people.reed.edu/~schroetd">Darrell Schroeter</a>.</p>
<p>I am also a training supervisor and senior reactor operator at the <a href="https://reactor.reed.edu">Reed Research Reactor</a>, responsible for implementing and managing a student-led training program to prepare trainees for Nuclear Regulatory Commision licensing exams, and furthering scientific research at the reactor facility.</p>
<p>Outside of physics, I am very interested in economics—especially the economics of networks and the role of information in creating efficient markets. After graduating from Reed, I hope to pursue a Ph.D. in economics, focusing on these topics.</p>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy long-distance train travel, kayaking, and cooking. I’m hoping to add more information on these things to the site at some point—stay posted!</p>
