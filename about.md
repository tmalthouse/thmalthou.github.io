I'm a student at Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg and research assistant at [ZEW Mannheim](https://zew.de), currently working on my MSc in Economics. I'm especially interested in public finance, procurement, and corruption.

In May 2020, I finished my undergraduate studies at Reed College in Portland, OR, where I studied physics. My senior thesis looked at the dynamics of open quantum systems and ways to simulate them on normal computers—a project involving some truly _massive_ matrices. While at Reed, I was also a senior operator and training supervisor at the [Reed Research Reactor](https://reactor.reed.edu), the only undergraduate-run nuclear reactor in the world.

In my free time, I like train travel (especially long, multi-day trips) and spending time outdoors hiking and cycling. I'm hoping to add something about these to this site, especially as I explore the region around Freiburg by bike.
